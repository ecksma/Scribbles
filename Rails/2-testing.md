## Why We Test

- save time when we create or update a project
- provide a better user experience
- create secure, functioning apps
- avoid unintentionally [killing people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25), [crashing the stock market](http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/09/technology/knight-expensive-computer-bug/), or [blowing things up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_(spacecraft)#Launch_failure)

Failures can be *very* costly.  Even if your app doesn't make life or death decisions or keep track of financial information, you **will** lose users when they have a negative experience with a buggy product.

### Types of Tests

* Unit Tests -- do small, low-level things work independetly? (e.g. a function or Model logic)
* Integration Tests -- do multiple smaller things work together correctly? (e.g. Controller logic)
* Acceptance Tests -- do elaborate, high-level things work as intended? (e.g. View logic).


## How We Test

### Automated Testing

As web developers, we'll use "automated testing" to check that our code is working as expected. Every time we make a change, we can re-run the automated tests to make sure we haven't broken anything.

**Automated testing is awesome! In the long term, you:**

* Save time you would have had to use checking through your program manually
* Avoid bugs by catching tricky edge cases
* Make it much easier to maintain, refactor, or extend your codebase
* Organize your tests and testing procedure in a way that's easy to find and understand


**Automated testing is a pain! In the short term, you:**

* Invest time up front deciding what to test
* Invest time up front to create good tests that
   * accurately check whether your code is working
   * test the _right_ things about your system
* Invest time to create new tests when you plan to add feature sets


###Development Patterns

We've looked at a few software development approaches so far.

For the first part of the course, we used a relaxed version of **Behavior Driven Development** (BDD). BDD has us build towards expected behaviors of our project both at the level of user interactions (building towards user stories) and at the level of code (writing out comments to say what each part of our code should do and building toward those).

We've also talked about **Error Driven Development** (EDD), using error messages as clues to help us build out a project. This is more feasible with tools like Rails that give us good error messages.  Error messages are used often, but EDD is not considered as effective a form of development as BDD or TDD.

For Rails apps, we'll emphasize **Test Driven Development**. We'll start by making a few goals for an app's behavoir.  Then, we'll write tests that can check whether we've met those goals... before we start to code! Finally, we'll write code we hope enables each behavior and check whether our code passes the test.   TDD tries to ensure that you understand the problem before coding a solution. It's also meant to keep programmers on track. If you write tests firsts, you're less likely to forget an important functionality.  As another benefit, TDD works well with pair programming.  You can "ping pong" the tests, having one person write them and another person write the code to pass them.

### Four Phase Tests

As we practice TDD, we'll focus on a four-phase testing methodology. Each test should *set up* some scenario, run an *exercise* starting from that scenario, *verify* that the intended effect happened, and *tear down* any changes that were made for the purpose of the test.

### Testing Tips

1. Don't try to test _everything_, unless you have a really critical mission (space travel, nuclear missile defense, pacemaker timing...).  Full testing, called "100% test coverage" is almost unheard of in software development. It would be overkill for the projects we're doing and for the work many companies do.

2. Write tests that help you be more efficient and effective as a developer.

## Testing Rails Applications

Though Rails has built-in tools for testing, Rails developers often use `rspec-rails`, `capybara`, and `Factory Girl` instead of those default tools.  Read the first 6 sections (down to and including "Factory Girl") of this [thoughtbot post about rails testing](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-we-test-rails-applications) that goes over these tools.


## Model Validations

Model-level validations are the best way to ensure that only valid data is saved into your database. They are database agnostic, cannot be bypassed by end users, and are convenient to test and maintain. Rails makes them easy to use and provides built-in helpers for common needs.

**Docs:** [Active Record Validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)

```ruby
#
# app/models/recipe.rb
#
class Recipe < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user

  # add validations
  validates :name, :instructions,
    presence: true,
    length: { maximum: 255 }
end
```

**Note:** The database columns `name` and `instructions` are strings. The `string` datatype is restricted to 255 characters in the database. Because of this, it's a good idea to put a length validation on any string column, so we can handle the error if the user tries to enter in more than 255 characters.

### Testing Validations in the Console

```ruby
$ rails c
irb(main):001:0> recipe = Recipe.create(name: nil, instructions: nil)
=> #<Recipe id: nil, name: nil, instructions: nil, user_id: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
irb(main):002:0> recipe.valid?
=> false
irb(main):003:0> recipe.errors.full_messages
=> ["Name can't be blank", "Instructions can't be blank"]
```

## Error-Handling

Model validations prevent users from saving invalid data to the database, but in order to provide a good experience for our users, we should do some error-handling in the controller.

```ruby
#
# app/controllers/recipe_controller.rb
#
class RecipesController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :authorize, except: [:index, :show]

  ...

  def create
    # recipe = current_user.recipes.create(recipe_params)
    # redirect_to recipe_path(recipe)

    # refactor
    recipe = current_user.recipes.new(recipe_params)
    if recipe.save
      redirect_to recipe_path(recipe)
    else
      redirect_to new_recipe_path
    end
  end

  ...

end
```

## Flash Messages

As part of our error-handling, it would be nice to let our users know when their actions succeed or fail - this is where flash messages come in.

The flash provides a way to pass temporary primitive-types (String, Array, Hash) between actions. Anything you place in the flash will be exposed to the very next action and then cleared out. This is a great way of doing notices and alerts before redirecting to a display action that can then expose the flash to its template.

**Docs:** [Flash](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html)

```ruby
#
# app/controllers/recipe_controller.rb
#
class RecipesController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :authorize, except: [:index, :show]

  ...

  def create
    recipe = current_user.recipes.new(recipe_params)
    if recipe.save
      flash[:notice] = "Successfully created recipe."
      redirect_to recipe_path(recipe)
    else
      flash[:error] = recipe.errors.full_messages.join(", ")
      redirect_to new_recipe_path
    end
  end

  ...

end
```

Setting flash messages in the controller makes them available in our view, but doesn't actually render them. To render flash messages, we need to explicitly display them in the view. It makes sense to put this in the application layout so it's rendered on every view.

```html
#
# app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
#
<body>
  <% flash.each do |name, msg| %>
    <%= content_tag :div, msg, class: "alert #{name == 'error' ? 'alert-danger' : 'alert-notice'}" %>
  <% end %>
</body>
```

## Review: RSpec Setup

1. Add `rspec-rails` to your `Gemfile` in the development and test groups. We'll also go ahead and add <a href="https://github.com/ffaker/ffaker" target="_blank">ffaker</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails" target="_blank">factory_girl_rails</a>:

  ```ruby
  #
  # Gemfile
  #
  group :development, :test do
    gem 'rspec-rails'
    gem 'ffaker'
    gem 'factory_girl_rails'
  end
  ```

2. Run `bundle` install to add the new gems to your project:

  ```
  $ bundle
  ```

3. Create the `spec` folder and set up `rspec-rails` configuration:

  ```
  $ rails g rspec:install
  ```

  This creates a `spec` directory. It also adds the configuration files `spec/spec_helper.rb`, `spec/rails_helper.rb` and `.rspec`. See those files for more information.

4. Configure your specs by going into the `.rspec` file and removing the line that says `--warnings` if there is one.

5. For any existing models or controllers you'd like to test, you'll have to manually create spec files:

  ```
  $ rails g rspec:model recipe
  $ rails g rspec:controller recipes
  ```

  **Note:** Spec files for any models or controllers you create AFTER you install `rspec-rails` will automatically be generated as long as you use `rails g ...` to create models/controllers.

6. To run all test specs, you can type `rspec` or `bundle exec rspec` in the terminal. To run only a specific set of tests, type `rspec` and the file path for the tests you want to run:

  ```ruby
  # run only model specs
  rspec spec/models

  # run only specs for `RecipesController`
  rspec spec/controllers/recipes_controller_spec.rb
  ```

## Controller Specs

Our goal is to write request specs for the `new` and `create` controller actions. It helps to first write out in plain English what exactly we'd like to test for each action.

### Testing `new`

We want to test the following assertions:
  1. It should respond with an HTTP status code of 200
  2. It should assign a new instance of `Recipe` in memory (allows us to use the `form_for` syntax in the view)
  3. It should render the `new` view (form to create a new recipe)

```ruby
#
# spec/controllers/recipes_controller_spec.rb
#
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe RecipesController, type: :controller do

  describe "#new" do
    before do
      get :new
    end

    it "should respond with 200 success" do
      expect(response.status).to be(200)
    end

    it "should assign @recipe" do
      expect(assigns(:recipe)).to be_instance_of(Recipe)
    end

    it "should render the :new view" do
      expect(response).to render_template(:new)
    end
  end

end
```

If we run our tests for `new` now, they're going to fail. This is because accessing `new` depends on having a `current_user`, since users must be logged in to see the view to create a new recipe. Our tests don't have any concept of `current_user` yet, so let's fix that. We could do something like the below, where we create and log in  `current_user` before each test:

```ruby
#
# spec/controllers/recipes_controller_spec.rb
#
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe RecipesController, type: :controller do
  before do
    user_params = Hash.new
    user_params[:first_name] = Faker::Name.first_name
    user_params[:last_name] = Faker::Name.last_name
    user_params[:email] = Faker::Internet.email
    user_params[:password] = Faker::Lorem.words(2).join
    # create and log in current_user
    current_user = User.create(user_params)
    session[:user_id] = current_user.id
  end

  ...

end
```

This will work, but it's not very DRY, since we may need to repeat the same logic in specs for other controllers that also require a `current_user`. We can solve this problem by using a factory to set up a `user` instance that's reuseable across all specs.

**Note:** Another benefit of using factories is that they can store a valid record in memory, without having to save it to our test database. Not saving records to the database significantly speeds up our tests. Read more about the `.build` (non-persistent) and `.create` (persistent) methods in the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md#using-factories">Factory Girl Getting Started Guide</a>.

### Factory Setup

1. Create a new folder in your `spec` directory called `factories`. Each factory should have its own file within the `factories` folder. We'll be creating a `user` factory in this example, so your folder structure should look like this:

  ```
  | spec
    | factories
      - user.rb
  ```

2. Inside the `user` factory, we'll move over some of the logic from our spec file used to create a new user:

  ```ruby
  #
  # spec/factories/user.rb
  #
  FactoryGirl.define do
    factory :user do
      first_name Faker::Name.first_name
      last_name Faker::Name.last_name
      email Faker::Internet.email
      password Faker::Lorem.words(2).join
    end
  end
  ```

3. In our controller spec, we can refactor our `current_user` logic to use the factory instead:

  ```ruby
  #
  # spec/controllers/recipes_controller_spec.rb
  #
  require 'rails_helper'

  RSpec.describe RecipesController, type: :controller do
    before do
      # create and log in current_user
      current_user = FactoryGirl.create(:user)
      session[:user_id] = current_user.id
    end

    ...

  end
  ```

### Testing `create`

We want to test the following assertions:
  1. When successful, it should add a new recipe to the database
  2. When successful, it should respond with an HTTP status code of 302 (found, or redirected)
  3. When successful, it should redirect to `recipe_path` (show page)
  4. When fails, it should respond with an HTTP status code of 302 (found, or redirected)
  5. When fails, it should redirect to `new_recipe_path`
  6. When fails, it should flash an error message

```ruby
#
# spec/controllers/recipes_controller_spec.rb
#
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe RecipesController, type: :controller do

  ...

  describe "#create" do
    context "success" do
      before do
        @recipes_count = Recipe.count
        post :create, recipe: {name: "Kale Salad", instructions: "Toss kale with apples and walnuts."}
      end

      it "should add new recipe" do
        expect(Recipe.count).to eq(@recipes_count + 1)
      end

      it "should respond with 302 found" do
        expect(response.status).to be(302)
      end

      it "should redirect_to 'recipe_path'" do
        expect(response.location).to match(/\/recipes\/\d+/)
      end
    end

    context "failure" do
      before do
        post :create, recipe: {name: nil, instructions: nil}
      end

      it "should respond with 302 found" do
        expect(response.status).to be(302)
      end

      it "should redirect to 'new_recipe_path'" do
        expect(response).to redirect_to(new_recipe_path)
      end

      it "should flash an error message" do
        expect(flash[:error]).to be_present
      end
    end
  end

end
```
