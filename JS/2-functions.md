Functions in JS
=======
>A function is a concrete implementation of an algorithm in a computer language. It is a "subprogram" that encapsulates a specific behavior.


**Declaration**

```javascript
  function foo() {
  }
```

####Benefits of Using Functions

* **Encapsulation** - Keeping code for the same purpose in the same place makes finding it and updating it easier.
* **Code Reuse** - "Don't Repeat Yourself" is a principle of coding - keep your programs **DRY**! Reusing code makes it easier to change how your program works, since you only have to make updates in one place. If you find yourself writing the same code two or more times, a good rule of thumb is to move it into a function!
