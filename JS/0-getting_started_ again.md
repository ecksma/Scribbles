Getting started with JS (again)
========================

#### Primitives
	  * Boolean
	  * Null (nonexistent object)
	  * Undefined (empty variable)
	  * Number (integer and floating point)
	  * String (words in quotes)
	  * Symbol (only in ES6)

```javascript
var foo = 42;    // foo is now a Number
var foo = "bar"; // foo is now a String
var foo = true;  // foo is now a Boolean
```
